# Django requires a unique secret key for each Django app, that is used by several of its
# security features. To simplify initial setup (without hardcoding the secret in the source
# code) we set this to a random value every time the app starts. However, this will mean many
# Django features break whenever an app restarts (for example, sessions will be logged out).
# In your production Heroku apps you should set the `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` config var explicitly.
# Make sure to use a long unique value, like you would for a password. See:
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/settings/#std-setting-SECRET_KEY
# https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars
# SECURITY WARNING: Keep the secret key used in production secret!

# Django has a debug mode which shows more detailed error messages and also means static assets
# can be served without having to run the production `collectstatic` command. However, this
# debug mode *must only be enabled in development* for security and performance reasons:
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/settings/#std-setting-DEBUG
# Debug mode will be automatically enabled when the project is run via `heroku local` (which
# loads the environment variables set in the `.env` file, where `ENVIRONMENT=development`).
# SECURITY WARNING: Don't run with debug turned on in production!

# The `DYNO` env var is set on Heroku CI, but it's not a real Heroku app, so we have to

    #    https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/automated-certificate-management
    # 2. Your app's WSGI web server is configured to use the `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers set by
    #    the Heroku Router (otherwise you may encounter infinite HTTP 301 redirects). See this
    #    app's `gunicorn.conf.py` for how this is done when using gunicorn.
